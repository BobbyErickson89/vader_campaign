# Darth for Galactic Overloard

This project was done as a coding challenge for Wide Eye Creative.
The goal was to develop a functioning splash page based on a design
mock-up given to me.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project on your local
machine.  No server-side code was needed for this, so it should be
fairly easy to get things up and running!

### Download the code to your local machine

We will want to pull the code from github.  Run this command in terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/BobbyErickson89/vader_campaign.git`

After successfully cloning the project in terminal, we will want to enter that folder.
 Our next command in terminal should be:

`cd vader_campaign`

### Run the file path URL in your browser

I've included links to all the libraries in the head of the main HTML file,
so there is no need for a package.json file or any kind of 'npm install' command.
All we have to do is paste the path to our index.html file.  It should look
something like this:

`/LOCAL_PATH/vader_campagin/index.html`

Hopefully this was useful in getting the code up and running on your machine.
