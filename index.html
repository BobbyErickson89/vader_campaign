            <p>
                Darth Vader has proven himself to be a leader in the Galactic Empire since it's conception after the
                successful take down of the Jedi Council.  Using his strength, wit, and sheer power of the Force, he has
                overseen successful campaigns such as the construction of the Death Star and the execution of Order 66.
            </p>

            <p>
                Along with being a cunning overlord for the Empire, Darth is a caring family man.  He constantly boasts of his
                twin children, Luke and Leia.  He hopes to have Luke by his side during his campaign, so that they can rule the
                galaxy together as father and son.
            </p>

            <p>
                Emperor Palpatine has shown a strong interest in Darth since he was a young Padowan, and has since become
                a valuable apprentice to the emperor.  However, it is time for a new galactic overlord.  Join Darth
                on the dark side of the Force and together, we can overthrow the emperor, destroy some Rebel scum, and claim
                Darth as our new Galactic Overlord!
            </p>
