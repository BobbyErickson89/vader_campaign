        There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.
        What? You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry.
        We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. No! Commence primary ignition.

        No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you.
        He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
        You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him.
        He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.
        And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to
        have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might
        follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
        <br>

        What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home!
        Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million.
        Remember, the Force will be with you...always.
        <br>

        Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir -- droids.
        <br>

        It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.
        Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
        Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them?
        I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.
        We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
        We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!
